# About LaTeX Lab

ðŸ‘‹ LaTeX Lab is a playful in-browser workspace for writing math. Everything you type is rendered instantly with KaTeX, so you can tweak a proof, draft notes, or rehearse a derivation without waiting on a compiler.

## What makes it feel nice
- **Mixed or Classic flow** â€” stay in text-first mode with inline math or flip a switch so every line becomes display equations.
- **Side-by-side focus** â€” resize the editor and preview panes, double-click to recenter, and watch your line numbers follow along as text wraps.
- **Dark mode on tap** â€” match your lighting and keep the canvas easy on the eyes.
- **Sticks with you** â€” your text, layout, theme, mode, cursor spot, and custom shortcuts are saved automatically in the browser.

## Handy tools built in
- **Matrix & table builders** drop ready-to-edit snippets, plus a quick Cases template for piecewise definitions.
- **Custom macros** let you paste your favourite `\newcommand` shortcuts, save them, and render right away.
- **Keyboard-friendly editing** adds bracket/dollar pairing, smart tab indenting, and scroll-synced gutters.
- **High-res exports** capture the rendered preview as a clean PNG at presentation-ready resolution.
- **Shareable states** bundle your work, layout, theme, and macros into a single link â€” perfect for handing a problem set to a teammate.

## Built for quick experiments
LaTeX Lab loads in any modern browser with no installs required. Type, toggle, export, and share â€” it is a lightweight lab bench whenever you need to sketch an idea or teach a concept.
